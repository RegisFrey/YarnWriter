# yarn-writer

> An experimental rebuild of the Yarn narrative editor with Vue2 and yarn.

This source is built for use with yarnpkg (package manager) https://yarnpkg.com or npm. I am mainly using the yarn package manage so changed the readme to use that.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies (must be done in both root and app directories)
yarn
# npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
yarn run dev

# build electron app for production
yarn run build

# lint all JS/Vue component files in `app/src`
yarn run lint

# run webpack in production
yarn run pack
```
